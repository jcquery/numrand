##Numrand

Numrand takes two numbers and (inclusively) finds a random number between them. And then it talks to you in a weird computer voice, because it's an Alexa skill.

I wanted a reason to play around with the Node.js Alexa SDK, so I threw this together in a few hours to see what it was like. As it turns out, it makes skill development smoother and more immediately understandable, so I'm looking forward to building something a little more complex.
